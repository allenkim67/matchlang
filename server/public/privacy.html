	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>Last modified: December 20, 2016</br>
		Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA. Since we started MatchLang, we’ve aspired to build our Services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind.</p>
		<p>MatchLang provides messaging, and other services to users around the world. Our Privacy Policy helps explain our information (including message) practices. For example, we talk about what information we collect and how this affects you. We also explain the steps we take to protect your privacy – like building MatchLang so delivered messages can be stored for the use of chat features offered to you and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services.</p>
		<p>When we say “MatchLang,” “our,” “we,” or “us,” we’re talking about MatchLang Inc. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all of our apps, services, features, software, and website (together, “Services”) unless specified otherwise.</p>
